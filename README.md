# Text-Messaging-Server-in-Java
The task was to implement a text-messaging server that can be used for exchanging text messaging. A text message contains a single line of ASCII text, sent to a single user. The two components of this system are; a message server that manages the messages and a telnet client that can be used to connect to the server and to send and receive messages. A partial implementation of the server will be made available to the students and in it its, in its current state, it allows users to Log In, Log Out, send a message, check for waiting messages and get the next message from the server. The server can be compiled and run, you can connect to it using telnet commands 101, 102, 103, 104 and 105 (see below) which are fully implemented. In its implemented state, the server requires a password file. The current location of the password file must be configured in the file MsgProtocol.java. The default location is "h:\\pwd.txt".
